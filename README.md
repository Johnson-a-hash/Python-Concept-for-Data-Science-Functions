# Python-Concept-for-Data-Science-Functions
In Python, a function is a group of related statements that performs a specific task. Functions help break our program into smaller and modular chunks. As our program grows larger and larger, functions make it more organized and manageable. Furthermore, it avoids repetition and makes the code reusable. There are many concepts in Python that are important Data Analysis. In this project, I write codes on python concepts (FUNCTIONS) for Data Science
